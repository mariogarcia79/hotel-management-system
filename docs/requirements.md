# Overview
Project name: Booking and Tasks Management System for a Hotel
Date: 2025-08-16
Purpose: The aim of this management system is primarily to personally learn TDD and OOP techniques and design principles, as well as practicing implementing design patterns, designing unitary test classes, and learn TypeScript with an interesting project. \
Also, this project is important for me because I feel it serves a good purpose. Some weeks ago, I was told by an entrepreneur --by that time my landlord, now my friend-- that online reservation sites can charge up to 25% of an actual reservation, which meant that she was losing each month a great deal of money. \
Just some days later, I started to work at a hostel, and came in contact with a real life hotel management system. Astonished with the level of integration and the capabilities of such system, I started thinking of the use cases of this type of system, and the opportunity I couldn't refuse to make one on my own. \
That's how this project came to life!

# Objectives
The main objective I want this system to fulfill is being able to effectively manage reservations and managing tasks for a simple small hotel or other kind of property such as an apartment or hostel.

# Scope
This project should let the guests make bookings and reservations, cancel them, or change the dates, as well as make payments and check availability of rooms. It should also let Employees manage all those things on behalf of a guest, as a client should be able to call the employee for making the reservation or make it on reception, without interacting with the system directly.
Employees should be able to manage the properties, creating and removing rooms from the system, as well as organizing work through the task and schedule system, associatedto different employees and roles.
Employees should also be able to add, remove and modify users in the system, as well as actually customizing the business model. \
On the other hand, managing multiple properties is out of the scope of this system. For that purpose, it is possible to define multiple properties as rooms inside a virtual Hotel.
